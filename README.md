# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

About the project`
Created Restaurant tables with their chairs.

1.First page show modal with their inputs and button, so that can create tables with their chairs.
You can write how many tables and chairs you want to be created.That data is stored in LocalStorage.
Once created it will take you to another page, where it will show the table and chairs you created.
For example` Created two table with their 3 chairs. Chairs will show with keys(1:,2:,3:).

2.The table header has a button, clicking on the button will remove the table and also will remove in LocalStorage.
By clicking on the chair item, will open modal, where can write name and will be added after writing
the elements place. We can also change name with the same steps.
You can move elements from one table to another table.

3.Second page we have two buttons, add tables and update chairs.
